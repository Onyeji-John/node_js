Classes:
They provide a structured way to create object using constructors and methods, facilitating object-oriented programming. They support inheritance, allowing classes to extend and reuse functionalityfrom other classes.

Arrow Functions:
It gives you a shorthand way to write functions and automatically use the "this" value from their surronding context, which is great for handling callbacks. They also let you return vlues without needing to write the return keyword, making your cide cleaner and easier to read.

Variables:
In JavaScript, you can create variables using "var", "let", and "const", where "let" and "const" help keep your code organized and prevent errors by limiting their scope. Plus, since JavaScript is dynamically typed, you can easily change the type of a variable as your program runs.

Array Methods:
JavaScript array methods are like useful tools that simplify working with arrays. Whether you're adding or removing items, transforming data, or looping through elements, these methods allow you to effortlessly manage and manipulate your collections.

Destructuring:
Destructuring in JavaScript is a neat way to pull out values from arrays and objects, making your code simpler and easier to read. It lets you quickly grab what you need without the clutter, whether you're working with straightforward lists or more complex nested data.

Modules:
JavaScript modules are like building blocks for your code, letting you organize it into smaller, reusable pieces. They help keep things tidy by allowing you to share functions and variables between files, making your projects easier to manage and collaborate on.

Ternary operator:
The ternary operator in JavaScript is a quick and tidy way to handle conditional checks. With its simple format, you can easily decide between two values based on a condition, making your code cleaner. Just keep in mind to use it wisely, as complex expressions can make things harder to read!
